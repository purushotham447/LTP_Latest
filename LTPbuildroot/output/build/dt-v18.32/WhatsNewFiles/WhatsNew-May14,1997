	The following changes have been made to 'dt' Version 10.8:

     o	Ali Eghlima added a "munsa={cr,pr,cw,pw,ex}" options which
	uses DLM for MUNSA testing.  Here's the 'dt' help text:

     MUNSA Lock Options:
        cr = Concurrent Read (permits read access, cr/pr/cw by others)
        pr = Protected Read (permits cr/pr read access to all, no write)
        cw = Concurrent Write (permits write and cr access to resource by all)
        pw = Protected Write (permits write access, cr by others)
        ex = Exclusive Mode (permits read/write access, no access to others)

            For more details, please refer to the dlm(4) reference page.

     o	If a "skip=" count is specified with an output file "of=",
	open the file for R/W access since skips are accompished via
	read()'s of record size.
	[ Per Olov Wahlstrom reported this problem. ]

     o	If a copy or verify operation is selected, and a data limit
	is specified, then double the data limit to account for double
	the I/O's.  Previously, only half of the desired data limit was
	copied and/or verified.

     o	Check status from closing file descriptor, and if it's not
	SUCCESS, use this for the exit status.  For tapes, deferred
	writes and failure to write file marks occur at close time.
	[ Roger Richardson reported this problem. ]

     o	If we encounter a ENOSPC error and no data has been transferred,
	flag this as an error.  This normally indicates a zero length
	partition or the user may have seek'ed past eom or eop.
	[ George Bittner reported this problem. ]

     o	Removed use of undocumented AIO_SEEK_CUR in aio_offset.
	Also fixed bug where random I/O offset was clobbered, thus
	resulting in sequential I/O.
	[ Jeff Denham reported this problem. ]

     o	Report number of I/O's per second (some people desire this).

	The latest version of 'dt' is available on our production machines
in the following account:
