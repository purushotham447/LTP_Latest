November 11th, 1999 Robin Miller

	The following changes were made to 'dt' Version 12.10:

     o	Support for logging diagnostic message to the event logger.
	This, of course, only applies to Tru64 Unix.  You must be root
	in order to log events to the binary error logger.  This support
	can be enabled one of two ways:
	- "enable=diag" option.
	- defining the DT_LOG_DIAG environment variable.

	If you aren't running as root, nothing gets logged, and no errors
	are reported by 'dt' (unless you turn on debug).

	Like other exercisers, Q-VET/diskx/tapex, the start and finish of
	each test is logged, as well as any errors encountered.

     o	Fixed a problem in the AIO module when testing with the IOT disc,
	and the CD-ROM block size was 2048.  The block size on the IOT disc
	is always 512 bytes.  This only effected Tru64 Unix.

     o	Fixed minor problem where "dispose=delete" wasn't parsed correctly.

     o	Fixed problem with setting stderr stream buffered (garbled output).

	Within Compaq, the updated 'dt' kits are located @ URL:

	External to Compaq, you can obtain 'dt' kits from URL:
