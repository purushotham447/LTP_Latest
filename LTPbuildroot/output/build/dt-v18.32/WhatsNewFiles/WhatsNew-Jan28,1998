	The following changes have been made to 'dt' Version 10.12:

     o	Add dtaio_close() function, to wait for queued I/O's when we're
	aborting, to avoid kernel I/O AIO rundown problem, which panic's
	the system if we close the CAM disk driver device descriptor,
	prior to AIO's completing (fixed in steelos by Anton Verhulst).
	[ Refernce QAR Number 57040 for more information. ]

	NOTE:  This problem is very prevalent when doing "cable pulls"
		or otherwise forcing CAM disk I/O's into error recovery
		and then aborting running 'dt's.  This I/O waiting only
		occurs once, as a 2nd signal (i.e. "kill" or <Ctrl/C>
		simply exits the program.  Beware of "kill -9" :-)

     o	Don't initialize data buffer being written for "disable=compare"
	which yields better performance.  Also correct a problem referencing
	memory map (mmap) data due to compiler optimization (reference_data()
	use static volatile). [ Changes requested by Marcus Barrow, thanks! ]

	The latest version of 'dt' is available on our production machines
in the following account or from my web page, shown below:

		Location: wasted:~rmiller/dt.d/{dt-ptos,dt-dlm,dt-V3.2}
				or via
		URL: http://www.zk3.dec.com/~rmiller/dt.html

	NOTE: DLM version of 'dt' hasn't been recompiled yet!

Cheers,
Robin
