<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes were made to <I>dt</I> Version 17.58:
<UL>
<LI>
Added prealloc flag for use with Windows when sparse files are disabled.
For Windows, when the sparse file attribute is disabled, add a new
preallocate method (seek/write at end of file), when random or reverse I/O
is enabled, to avoid long no-progress messages. This write is NOT timed,
thus allowing NTFS to preallocate data blocks before the writes begin.
<p>
enable/disable= flags Added:
<pre>
    prealloc         Preallocate w/o sparse.(Default: enabled)
</pre>
<p>
<li>
Add iotune=file to allow IO delays to be overriden from a file while running.
<p>
Options Added:
<pre>
    iotune=filename  Set I/O tune delay parameters via file.
</pre>
The delay values accepted from the I/O tune file are:
<p>
<pre>
    io_delay=value      Sets both the read and write delays.
    close_delay=value   Sets the close file delay.
    end_delay=value     Sets the end of pass delay.
    start_delay=value   Sets the start of test delay.
    read_delay=value    Sets the read delay.
    write_delay=value   Sets the write delay.
</pre>
Multiple delays should be placed on one line with a space between delay options.
<p>
The I/O tune file will be checked by the IO monitoring thread, and will be checked
once a second, unless the alarm=value option is specified to set the interval.
<p>
This I/O tune file is a method by which one can do dynamic tuning (a.k.a. throttling
I/O). It's expected an external process will monitor ONTAP CPU and disk utilization,
then pass delays via this file to decrease or increase I/O loads (across all test clients).
Note: The ability to dynamicaly add processes or threads to increase IO load is not
possible at this time, therefore one can only set the delays to zero to increase load.
<p>
Please Note: This external monitoring process has *not* been developed as of yet!
<p>
<li>
Allow keyword 'random' with *delay values to support random IO delays.
<p>
<pre>
    Example: rdelay=random wdelay=random
</pre>
When microdelay is enabled, the delay is between 1 and 1000000, but the actual
delay will be a minimum of 1ms (at present), until we switch to real time timers.
<p>
Note: This feature was taken from the sio tool, where "-think random" is available.
<p>
<li>
Added enable=reread option for use with read-after-write (raw) option.
This allows a full read pass to help determine if data was incorrectly changed
after the initial write/read/verify pass. This adds an extra debug data point.
<p>
<li>
When "deleteperpass" option is enabled, do NOT delete the files when the
error limit is reached, otherwise the files cannot be reread for analysis.
The terminate function will honor the dispose={delete|keep|keeponerror} setting.
</ul>
