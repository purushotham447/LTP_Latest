<CENTER><H2><STRONG>What's New as of February 21, 1996</STRONG></H2></CENTER>

<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes have been made to <I>dt</I> Version 9.4:
<UL>
<LI>An option has been added to allow random I/O to be selected instead
of the default sequential I/O.  This is accomplished via:
<P>
<PRE>
	iotype=type	Set I/O type to: {random or sequential}.
</PRE>
The seeks are limited to the data limited specified or calculated
from the <I>dt</I> command line.  If data limits aren't specified, seeks
are limited to the size of existing files, or to the entire disk
(obtained via ioctl() Digital Unix for raw devices).  If the data
limits exceed the capacity of the media/partition/file under test,
a premature end-of-file will be encountered on reads or writes.
<P>
<LI>An option was added to control checking of inverted data bytes when
doing long reads of short tape records.  Previously, certain DME's
would transfer garbage data at the end of short records, but since
this garbage is not included in the read() count returned, is not
normally accessed by programs, and does not exceed users' buffers,
this was deemed acceptable.
[ Reference QAR 40101 for more information. ]
<P>
By default, this check is now disabled, but can be re-enabled via
the "enable=spad" option (short pad check) if desired.
<P>
<LI>Makefile and source conditionalized so <I>dt</I> now builds on LINUX.
</UL>
<P>
The latest version of <I>dt</I> is available on our production machines
in the following account:
