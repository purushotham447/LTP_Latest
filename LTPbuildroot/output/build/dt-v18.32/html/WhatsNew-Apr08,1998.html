<CENTER><H2><STRONG>What's New as of April 8th, 1998</STRONG></H2></CENTER>

<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes have been made to <I>dt</I> Version 10.15:
<UL>
<LI>When terminating, call close function before reporting stats,
since in the case of AIO the I/O rundown updates statistics
with outstanding requests, when we're aborted by a signal.
<LI>Setup the pattern as a pattern string, so non-modulo sizeof(u_int)
read counts will data compare properly.  Also fixed reopen code
so it properly handles piping of stdin and stdout file descriptors.
[ see example attached below ]
</UL>
