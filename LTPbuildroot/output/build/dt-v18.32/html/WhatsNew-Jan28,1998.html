<CENTER><H2><STRONG>What's New as of January 28th, 1998</STRONG></H2></CENTER>

<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes have been made to <I>dt</I> Version 10.12:
<UL>
<LI>Add dtaio_close() function, to wait for queued I/O's when we're
aborting, to avoid kernel I/O AIO rundown problem, which panic's
the system if we close the CAM disk driver device descriptor,
prior to AIO's completing (fixed in steelos by Anton Verhulst).
[ Refernce QAR Number 57040 for more information. ]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
NOTE:  This problem is very prevalent when doing "cable pulls"
or otherwise forcing CAM disk I/O's into error recovery
and then aborting running 'dt's.  This I/O waiting only
occurs once, as a 2nd signal (i.e. "kill" or <Ctrl/C>
simply exits the program.  Beware of "kill -9" :-)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Don't initialize data buffer being written for "disable=compare"
which yields better performance.  Also correct a problem referencing
memory map (mmap) data due to compiler optimization (reference_data()
use static volatile). [ Changes requested by Marcus Barrow, thanks! ]
