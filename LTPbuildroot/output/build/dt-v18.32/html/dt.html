<H2>What Is this Program Used For?</H2>
    <I>dt</I> is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the
operating system.  In its' simplest mode of operation, <I>dt</I> writes and then
verifys its' default data pattern, then displays performance statisics and other
test parameters before exiting.  Since verification of data is performed,
<I>dt</I> can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
<P>
    <I>dt</I> is conditionalized to run on Tru64 UNIX, HP-UX, SUN, ULTRIX, OSF/MK,
QNX, Linux, SCO Unixware, and Windows operating systems.  There are two versions
of <i>dt</i> for Windows, the previous version which requires the Cygnus Solutions
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/"><I>cygwin</I> toolkit</A>, and a
native version found under the windows subdirectory (Debug and Release versions).
<P>
    <I>dt</I> command lines are similar to the <I>dd</I> program, which is
popular on most UNIX systems.  It contains numerous options to give the user
control of various test parameters.
<P>
    <I>dt</I> has been used to successfully test disks, tapes, serial lines,
parallel lines, pipes, and memory mapped files.  In fact, <I>dt</I> can be used
for any device that allows the standard open, read, write, and close system
calls.  Special support is necessary for some devices, such as serial lines,
for setting up the speed, parity, data bits, etc.

<H2>Releases</H2>
Within NetApp, <i>dt</i> releases are maintained by the SAN Host Utility team in
RTP, namely Tom Masterson, who maintains 
<a href="http://wikid.netapp.com/w/Blocks_host/Automation/DT_versions">this Wiki</a>
describing the latest versions of <i>dt</i>.

<H3>Prebuilt Executables</H3>
Within NetApp, you can find prebuilt <i>dt</i> executables here:
<DL>
    <DD>/usr/software/test/bin/dt.stable - stable version of dt (reference <a href="http://wikid.netapp.com/w/Blocks_host/Automation/DT_versions">this Wiki</a>)
    <DD>/usr/software/test/bin/dt.latest - latest version of dt

	<DD>X:\SAN\bin\common\{dt.stable,dt.latest,dt.staging}\dt.exe - Windows versions
</DL>
The dt.stable and dt.latest symbolic links are recommended to use the most stable or latest versions.
Note: dt.latest is the most current and will be staging to dt.stable. dt.staging is the most recent.
<P>
Also Note: A new common naming convention is being used for all IO Tools at NetApp:
<DL>
    <DD>/usr/software/test/bin/dt now points to current dt
    <DD>/usr/software/test/bin/dt.current points to latest dt (same as dt.latest)
    <DD>/usr/software/test/bin/dt.last points to the last build (same as dt.staging)
	<DD>X:\bin\{dt.exe,dt.current.exe,dt.last.exe} - Windows versions of the same

<H2>Uses For <I>dt</I>:</H2>
Those people with an imagination can find many uses for <I>dt</I>, but
I'll list a few just to whet your appetite:
<UL>
<LI>Testing of tape devices using different block sizes to determine
the best blocking factor for optimum performance and capacity.
This is very important for streaming tapes devices.
<LI>Write tapes to end of tape, to determine the total tape capacity.
This gives the total data capacity of tapes, after inter-record
gaps, preamble/postambles, or pad blocks are written on the tape.
<LI>Read existing tapes with data comparison disabled, to determine
the amount of data on the tape.  This is useful to determine how
much disk space is required to read in a tape, or to simply verify
the tape can be read without errors.
<LI>Reading/writing an entire tape to ensure device drivers properly
sense and handle end of tape error conditions.
<LI>Write a tape and ensure it can be read on another tape drive to
test drive compatibility (also referred to as transportability).
<LI>Read multiple tape files to ensure file marks and end of tape are
reported and handled properly by tape drivers.
<LI>I/O to disks using the raw device interface, to determine the
optimum performance of the controller.  This usually gives a
good indication of how well the controller cache or read-ahead
improves I/O performance for sequential file access.
<LI>I/O to disk files through the file system, to determine the affect
the buffer cache has on write and read performance.  You must know
the characteristics of your O/S's buffer cache to select file sizes
to either get optimum performance from the cache, or to defeat the
affect of the buffer cache.
<LI>Reading/writing of entire disks, to ensure the media capacity and
error handling is properly reported by device drivers.
<LI>Test memory mapped files to compare I/O performance against raw
and file system I/O.  Typically, memory mapped I/O approaches the
raw device performance.
<LI>Testing I/O to files on NFS mounted file systems.  This will give
you a good indication of your ethernet performance to remote files.
<LI>Writing/reading pipes to verify pipe operation and performance.
<LI>Initiating multiple processes to test optimizations of buffer cache,
device drivers, and/or intelligent controllers.  This is also useful
to test multiple device access and for loading the I/O sub-system.
<LI>Force I/O at different memory boundaries to test low level driver
handling.  Using the align option, you can set memory alignment for
testing specialized device driver DMA code.  This is very useful
when developing new I/O sub-systems.
<LI>Do loopback testing of parallel or serial lines on either the same
system or different systems.  This is a useful compatibility test
when running different machines running different operating systems.
<LI>Enable POSIX Asynchronous I/O to verify proper operation of this API
and to determine performance gains (over standard synchronous I/O).
This is also useful for queuing multiple I/O requests to drivers and
for testing SCSI tag queuing and RAID configurations.
<LI>Specify variable record options for testing variable tape devices.
<LI>
On Tru64 cluster systems, distributed lock manager (DLM) options can
be used to control access to shared devices or files.
<LI>
Also available on Tru64 UNIX is the ability to use Extended Error
information (EEI) to detect and recover from SCSI bus/device resets
(tape is repositioned for continuing the test).
</UL>
    Although I've started to add specific testing of serial lines with modem
control, this support is incomplete and untested.
<P>
    I hope you find <I>dt</I> as useful as I have.  This is usually one of the
first tools I port to a new operating system, since it's an excellent diagnostic
and performance tool.

        The default base for numeric input is decimal, but you can override
        this default by specifying 0x or 0X for hexadecimal conversions, or
        a leading zero '0' for octal conversions.  NOTE: Evaluation is from
        right to left without precedence, and parenthesis are not permitted.
