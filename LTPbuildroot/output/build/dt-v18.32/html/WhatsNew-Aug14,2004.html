<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
This is a major release of <I>dt</I>, which includes several bug
fixes and new features.
<P>
The following changes were made to <I>dt</I> Version 15.10:
<UL>
<LI>
Ported to AIX.
<LI>     
Added <I>enable=hazard</I> to support "dt stress" test configuration
under Hazard test suite.  This option causes errors to be written
to stdout, instead of stderr, with a special severity prefix.
<LI>       
Added <I>enable/disable=fsalign</I> to allow non-block aligned I/O
for file system testing.  The default is off (disabled), so
variable lengths via incr=var and non-block random offsets
are possible.  Use enable=fsalign to enable previous behavior.
<LI>       
Fixed random I/O offsets for large capacity disks.  Previously
when compiled for 32 bits, offsets were truncated to 32 bits.
<LI>
When position=offset option is used, prevent I/O prior to this
offset when doing reverse I/O.
<LI>
For Linux, use IOCTL to obtain sector size & partition capacity.
Why? The partition capacity may not be the actual disk capacity,
and allows bypassing 'dt' calculating capacity for random I/O.
<LI>
For HP-UX, added <I>qdepth=N</I> option to set a new queue depth.  This
setting is "sticky", meaning the previous setting isn't restored.
The default queue depth on current HP-UX is 8, but this option
can be used to generate a higher I/O load when doing async I/O.
<LI>       
Added support for <I>trigger=action</I> option, which is invoked when
errors occur.  When using the "trigger=cmd:string" type, the
tester can then do special handling of errors, like panic'ing
the system, doing expanded corruption analysis, etc.
<PRE>
	trigger=type     The trigger to execute during errors.

	Trigger Types:
            br = Execute a bus reset.
            bdr = Execute a bus device reset.
            seek = Issue a seek to the failing lba.
            cmd:string = Execute command with these args:
              string dname op dsize offset position lba errno
	      where:
	        dname = The device/file name.
	        op = open/close/read/write/miscompare
	        dsize = The device block size.
	        offset = The current file offset.
	        position = The failing offset within block.
	        lba = The logical block address (relative for FS).
	        errno = The error number on syscall errors.

            The first three options require Scu in your PATH, since
	Scu is used to execute these operations.
