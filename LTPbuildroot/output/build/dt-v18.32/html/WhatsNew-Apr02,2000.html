<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes have been made to <I>dt</I> Version 13.10:
<UL>
<P>
<B>13.6 -> 13.7</B>
<P>
<LI>
In HandleMultiVolume(), reset the exit status to SUCCESS, since
this got set to END_OF_FILE earlier.  Failure to do this meant we
exited with an END_OF_FILE (254) status on the read pass instead
of SUCCESS (0).
<P>
<B>13.7 -> 13.8</B>
<P>
<LI>Fixed parsing of flags=direct for Tru64 Clusters.
<LI>Don't permit passes=0, as this caused segmentation fault.
<LI>Don't create unique file names with procs= to named FIFO.
<P>
<B>13.8 -> 13.9</B>
<P>
<LI>Added "capacity=value" option, and ignore read errors in
FindCapacity() called for iotype=random option.
<LI>Fixed problem with "position=value" truncating file position
to 32 bits, since the file offset may be a 64-bit entity (off_t).
<LI>Improved file position functions to provide better debug output.
Also, only scale the random position upwards by the device size
every other record, so low blocks gets utilized more often.
Note: These changes degrade random I/O performance slightly.
[ for "best" performance, all debug really needs omitted, but
currently there's no way to permit this (future consideration). ]
<LI>Fixed exit status when "runtime=" option used.  This exit path
only looked at error_count to set FAILURE exit status, while
non-runtime exit path looked at exit_status variable.
<P>
Note: The ignoring of read error in FindCapacity(), was added
for reading ATAPI CD's on Linux, since this driver does *not*
properly handle seek/reads past the end of media.  The last good
read gets used when the read error occurs.  Use "capacity=value"
to avoid this error condition. [ occurs on RedHat Linux V6.1 ]
<P>
<B>13.9 -> 13.10</B>
<P>
<LI>
Minor change for QNX operating system.  Stat'ing block devices
returns the number of blocks in st_size field, which needed scaled
by the block size (512 bytes), before setting the random data limit
and disk capacity.  This only affected random I/O tests.
