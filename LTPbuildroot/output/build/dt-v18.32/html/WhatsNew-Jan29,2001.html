<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
This is a major release of <I>dt</I>.  Many new features have been
added, and the code has been restructured quite a bit to accomodate
these changes and future enhancements.
<P>
The following changes were made to <I>dt</I> Version 14.0:
<UL>
<LI>
Slice & Dice:  A powerful new option (IMHO) has been added
for random access devices.  A slices=value option was added
which divides the media into slices.  Each slice contains a
a range of blocks to operate on.  If no pattern is specified,
each slice is started with a different data pattern.  Each
subsequent pass alternates through the 12 internal patterns.
<P>
Furthermore, each slice can have multiple processes and/or
async I/O's (aios=value).  So with a single command, you can
generate a very heavy I/O load, great for stress testing!
<P>
Note: AIO is only supported on Tru64 Unix and SCO UnixWare.
<LI>
You can now enable variable length request sizes, by using
incr=var{iable} with the min/max= options.  The request size
calcualated will (of course) be between the min/max values
and be device size bytes aligned. (see example below)
<LI>
It is now possible to specify the I/O direction for random
access devices (disks, CD-ROM's, file system, etc).  The new
iodir={forward,reverse} option controls this.  When reverse
I/O reaches the beginning of media, <I>dt</I> will exit with 254,
which is its' normal end of file (EOF) status code.
<LI>
Random I/O options (iotype=random or iodir=reverse) is now
supported with regular files (i.e., files on a file system).
The only caveat is that you must specify a data limit using
the limit/records= options, since my find capacity algorthm
won't work with regular files :-)
<LI>
The hard coded 512 byte blocking previously imposed with the
IOT test pattern (pattern=iot) has been lifted. The blocking
used is setup from 1) dsize=value option, 2) lbs=value option,
3) device IOCTL (Tru64 only), or 4) defaults to 512 bytes.
This restriction was lifted, since the Windows IOT test discs
are blocked at 2048 bytes (native CD-ROM 2K block size).
<LI>
Windows enhancements were made to recognize physical devices
and Cygnus mounted tape names (/dev/rmtN and /dev/nrmtN),
which is necessary for proper tape operation.
<LI>
The "volumes=" and "vrecords=" options have been added to aid
with multi-volume testing, esp. for tapes.  With these options
you simply tell <I>dt</I> how many volumes to write, and the number
of records to write on the last volume.  This resolves capacity
guessing problems with tapes, where data compression and varying
media capacities, were problematic for our test scripts.
<P>
Also Note:  After changing media and continuing, if using a tape
device, a rewind operation is performed to ensure the device is
ready before continuing.  This latter check is esp. important when
changing tapes on Linux and Windows.
<LI>
Additional checking to catch illegal or dangerous combinations
of options.  For example, for IOT or Lbdata options, the block
size must be greater than sizeof(u_int32), which is the size
of the lba encoded at the beginning of each record.
<LI>
Better sanity checking for random access device options. The
major checks in this area are to ensure block sizes are modulo
the device size.  This additional checking can be bypassed by
using the new "enable=bypass" option (this latter option may
by of interest to those of you on Tru64 Unix doing non-modulo
disk block access).  In general, these sanity checks prevent
unexpected test failures.
<LI>
When using multiple processes (procs=) with regular files, a
different pattern is used for each file, unless you specify a
pattern to use.  Use the disable=unique to avoid this action.
This pattern usage is consistent with that implemented with
The new slices= option (i.e. different pattern for each slice).
<LI>
The "rseed=value" no longer enabled random I/O automatically.
This option simply sets the random number generator seed now,
since this option is necessary for variable request sizes too.
<LI>
When "enable=Debug" is specified, when using rotating media
or the IOT/Lbdata options, the lba is now reported with record
information.
<LI>
Extended statistics are reported when random I/O and/or slices
options were specified.
<LI>
When aborting child processes, a SIGINT is now sent instead
of SIGTERM, so the child process can report its' statistics.
This was important for long running tests.  If SIGINT is
problematic, I'll add an option to specify the kill signal.
<LI>
Some functions were converted to macros to inline code, which
hopefully improves performance a little.
<LI>
Existing output files are no longer deleted automatically.
Only files created by <I>dt</I> get deleted.  Use dispose=delete,
*if* you want existing output files deleted.
<LI>
When using multiple slices to an existing output file, the
file is *not* deleted to avoid races with multiple procs.
</UL>
<P>
Please see attached examples for use of these new options.
