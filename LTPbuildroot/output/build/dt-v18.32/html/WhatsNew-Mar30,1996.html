<CENTER><H2><STRONG>What's New as of March 30, 1996</STRONG></H2></CENTER>

<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
The following changes have been made to <I>dt</I> Version 10.2:
<UL>
<LI>An I/O mode option "iomode={copy, test, or verify}" has been added.
The default mode is "test", so existing functionality does not change.
The "copy" mode allows you to specify both input and output devices,
the same as 'dd', for copying data from one device to another.  After
the copy operation completes the data is automatically verified, unless
disabled via specify "disable=verify".  The "verify" mode simply does
a data verification of the two devices (or files) specified.
<P>
Why was this option added? (my little story)
<P>
In the past, I've purposely omitted 'dd' functionality, since they serve
different needs (copy versus testing).  Well, one of my disks developed
a bad block which could not be reassigned.  Since the bad block was in
/etc, I decided to copy the root partition to salvage what I could.  It
was then, that I discovered the 'dd's "conv=noerror,sync" options did
not work as advertised (yes, I took the time to QAR 'dd').  Well, to
make a long story shorter, I added the necessary logic to <I>dt</I> to copy
and properly skip bad blocks, and since <I>dt</I> already did verification,
this was an added bonus.
<P>
Caveats:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>writes get done synchronously when AIO is chosen (read are async).
<LI>the seek, skip, and block size options apply to both devices.
</UL>
<P>
These new options open a new realm of possibilities over 'dd' (IMHO):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>performance statistics can be obtained for device copy operations.
<LI>the copy w/verify gives you that "warm and cozy" feeling when done.
<LI>if errors occur during a copy, better error information is available.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>In conjuction with the above, proper handling of bad blocks is now done.
Hmmm, what does that mean?  Well, of course EIO doesn't tell you a whole
lot, but if you're testing a random I/O device, and you specify an error
limit greater than 1, <I>dt</I> will attempt to lseek() past the erroring lba
to continue the copy/test/verify operation (this is 'dd' bug w/noerror).
<P>
<LI>When random I/O is selected, it's no longer necessary to specify a data
limit or record count with random access devices.  <I>dt</I> automatically
uses an algorithm using lseek()/read()'s to find the maximum capacity.
<P>
<LI>When selecting random I/O and executing multiple processes, <I>dt</I> now
uses both time(0) and the pid to ensure each process gets a different
seed for random number generator.
</UL>
<P>
The latest version of <I>dt</I> is available on our production machines
in the following account:
