<H2>Changes For This Release</H2>
This is a major release of <I>dt</I>, which includes several bug
fixes and new features.
<P>
The following changes were made to <I>dt</I> Version 15.34:
<UL>
<LI>
For AIX, implemented IOCINFO to obtain the device size and capacity.
<LI>     
When random I/O is used, scale the random number by a multiplier
and the device block size, to obtain larger offset for >1TB capacities.
<LI>
Updated report_record(), used by debug code, since LBA's are now
treated as 64-bit values to support capacities over 2TB!
<LI>
Converted User's Guide from troff/tbl to MS Word and updated the documentation!
<LI>
Fixed logic error where we were reopen'ing the file in preparation
for the next write pass, when we've reached the error limit.  This was
a problem if oflags=trunc and dispose=keep were used since the resulting
output file would be zero length.
<LI>
Added support for "enable=timestamp" option to write a timestamp
at the beginning of each data block to help troubleshooting corruptions.
<LI>
If regular file is not open when terminating, do not try to delete.
Added warning in delete_file() if file cannot be unlink'ed, but
this should never occur now that terminate() only calls if it's open.
<LI>
Added check for non-modulo block size patterns, when random I/O is
enabled, to avoid false data corruption when blocks are overwritten.
<LI>
The exit status of programs/scripts executed via "trigger=cmd:" is now
used to determine subsequent action when returning to <i>dt</i>.<br>
The actions supported are:
<pre>
	0 = Continue running
	1 = Terminate test
	2 = Sleep indefinitely
	3 = Abort generating core.
</pre>
<LI>
Added options "noprog" and "noprogt" to be used in conjunction with
alarm option to detect no (or slow) I/O progress being made.  This
is very handy when doing cluster failover testing, to determine how
long it takes for I/O to continue.  For example: alarm=2s noprogt=45s
means set an alarm for every 2 seconds, and if I/O has not made progress
in 45 seconds, report the fact and optionally execute a trigger script.
<LI>
For AIX, added support for POSIX Asynchronous I/O.<br>
Note: Legacy AIO can be enabled for pre-AIX 5.2 (see dtaio.c)
<LI>
Added support for AIX tape operations.
<LI>
Added AIO support for Windows.
<LI>
Added keepalive format control string parsing.
<pre>
    Keepalive Format Control:
            %b = The bytes read or written.  %B = Total bytes read and written.
            %c = Record count for this pass. %C = Total records for this test.
            %d = The device name.            %D = The real device name.
            %e = The number of errors.       %E = The error limit.
            %f = The files read or written.  %F = Total files read and written.
            %h = The host name.              %H = The full host name.
            %k = The kilobytes this pass.    %K = Total kilobytes for this test.
            %l = Blocks read or written.     %L = Total blocks read and written.
            %m = The megabytes this pass.    %M = Total megabytes for this test.
            %p = The pass count.             %P = The pass limit.
            %r = Records read this pass.     %R = Total records read this test.
            %s = The seconds this pass.      %S = The total seconds this test.
            %t = The pass elapsed time.      %T = The total elapsed time.
            %i = The I/O mode (read/write)   %u = The user (login) name.
            %w = Records written this pass.  %W = Total records written this test.

    Performance Keywords:
            %bps  = The bytes per second.    %lbps = Logical blocks per second.
            %kbps = Kilobytes per second.    %mbps = The megabytes per second.
            %iops = The I/O's per second.    %spio = The seconds per I/O.

      Lowercase means per pass stats, while uppercase means total stats.

      Default: %d Stats: mode %i, blocks %l, %m Mbytes, pass %p/%P, elapsed %t
                     or if pass statistics summary is disabled:
               %d Stats: mode %i, blocks %L, %M Mbytes, pass %p/%P, elapsed %T

</pre>
<LI>
For QNX, change hardware flow control flags (IHFLOW | OHFLOW)
from c_lflag to c_cflag field in the termios structure.
